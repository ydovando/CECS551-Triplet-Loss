# input: an image (x) which includes a human face
# intermediate step: Find bounding box of the face in the input
# output: embedding  vector (f(X) in R ^{d}) in d-dimensional Euclidean space of the bounding box.
# the embedding vector should be normalized ||f(x)||_{2} = sum( f_{i}(x)^2) =1 from i to d
