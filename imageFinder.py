#input: a group id
#intermediate steps: 
        ##1) using the highest p_{c} of the face detection software,
        ##2) store one image for each member in the group. in total, you should have 3 images (1 per group member)

#output: images of group members


# get group id 


def getImagesForGroup(x):
        
        # find the images of the group based on the first character of the file name



        # using YOLO face detection algorithm save the one with the highest pc


        # save name of image with highest pc for that group member
